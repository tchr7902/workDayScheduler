# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This project is an application that allows the user to plan out their 9-5 day by adding events for different times throughout the day. When the user submits data, that data is saved to local storage, and then that data is saved to the hour it was inputted for.

This project helped me learn how to use APIs and also solidified my knowledge of certain JavaScript skills. It has actual function and real life use, and taught me very fundamental aspects of JavaScript.
